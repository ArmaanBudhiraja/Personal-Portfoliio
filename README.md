# 🌐 My Portfolio

This is my personalized portfolio website — designed and developed to showcase my **skills, projects, and creativity** in a professional yet aesthetic way.

## 🚀 Features
- Responsive design for all devices 📱💻
- Smooth navigation with a custom navbar
- Gradient backgrounds & clean typography
- Highlighted sections: About, Skills, Projects, Contact
- Minimal + modern aesthetic (with a little chaos 😅)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React.js** – component-based UI
- **CSS3 / Tailwind (optional)** – styling & responsiveness
- **Google Fonts** – typography (Bebas Neue, Fira Code, Menlo)
- **GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify** – deployment

## 🎨 Design
The design is inspired by **professional portfolios** but with a personal twist. I’ve experimented with:
- Gradients & box shadows for depth
- Playful typography choices
- Chaotic/fun “Hire Me” section 🔥

## 📌 Deployment
